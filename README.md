### Version info

This app was originally generated on Sat Mar 20 2021 22:31:38 GMT+0100 (Central European Standard Time) using Sails v1.4.2.

<!-- Internally, Sails used [`sails-generate@2.0.3`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate/tree/v2.0.3/lib/core-generators/new). -->

This project's boilerplate is based on an expanded seed app provided by the [Sails core team](https://sailsjs.com/about) to make it easier for you to build on top of ready-made features like authentication, enrollment, email verification, and billing. For more information, [drop us a line](https://sailsjs.com/support).
